'Where IOT meets Blockchain......'
<br/>

## By Team Delta_Codinators

<br/>
Hercules is an IoT-powered Home-Automation system with a Blockchain-based Electricity consumption recording, billing and payment mechanism. It provides a dApp for users to control their home appliances with just the click of buttons on the dApp. Home-Automation is executed using the Bolt IoT Wi-Fi Module and the dApp can be deployed on Matic.
<br/>
The electricity consumption of the user is analysed and stored on the Blockchain and Billing is done accordingly. This amount can be paid in crypto to the Electricity Board.
